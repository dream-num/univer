When I give you a figma link, it means you need to get the design from figma. And help me to implements it as a react component. 
Please only use less and html element (don't use button) only to write this component. 
Please write a storybook demo for this component, please put storbook demo in the same directory with the component, storybook demo like packages/design/src/components/date-picker/DatePicker.stories.tsx.
Please note all interface should start with `I`. 
Please make all svg file to react-component. make sure all files in one dir. 
If the component include list items. you should using dataset and map to make sure this is configurable.
Please note that design token file is [base.less](mdc:packages/design/src/themes/base.less)
