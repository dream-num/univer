## Contributing Code

### Install dependencies

Univer requires Node.js >= 18.17.0. We recommend using nvm or fnm to switch between different versions of Node.js.

```shell
git clone http://github.com/dream-num/univer
cd univer

# install package manager pnpm
npm i -g pnpm

# install dependencies
pnpm install

```

### Start dev server

```shell
pnpm dev
```

### Architecture

Please refer to [Architecture](https://univer.ai/guides/sheet/architecture/univer), and also [ISOMORPHIC.md](./docs/ISOMORPHIC.md) for more guidance on how to set up plugins.

### Source code organization

The structure of the repository is as follows:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ common/ shared configuration and utilities
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/ documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ e2e/ e2e test cases
â”œâ”€â”€ examples/ demos running on the web
â”œâ”€â”€ examples-node/ demos running on Node.js
â”œâ”€â”€ mockdata/ mock data for development
â”œâ”€â”€ packages/ Univer core and plugins
â”œâ”€â”€ packages-experimental/ experimental plugins (not published on npm.com)
```

The file structure of a plugin should be organized as follows:

```
|- common/
|- models/
|- services/
|- commands/
  |- commands/
  |- mutations/
  |- operations/
|- controllers/
|- views/
  |- components/
  |- parts/
|- plugin.ts
|- index.ts
```

There are some limits on what paths could a file import from.

-   common cannot import file in other folders
-   models can only import files from common
-   services can only import files from models and common
-   commands can only import files from common, models and services

During the refactoring process, it is recommended to remove legacy folders such as `Enum`, `Interface`, `Basics`, and `Shared`.

Avoid creating barrel imports (index.ts) unless it is the main root index.ts file of a plugin.

#### Desktop & Mobile

We added experimental support for mobile platforms since June 2024. After that, all UI plugins should split ui related code by their running platforms:

```
|- controllers/
  |- render-controllers/
    |- common/
    |- desktop/
    |- mobile/
|- views/
  |- components/
    |- common/
    |- desktop/
    |- mobile/
  |- parts/
    |- common/
    |- desktop/
    |- mobile/
```

### Connecting context

To effectively contribute as a member of a software engineering team (and community as well!), it is crucial to establish strong contextual connections. Providing links to relevant resources can greatly assist others in understanding the context. Consider the following practices:

- Include the link to the corresponding issue in your commit message.
- Leave comments with links to the relevant context within the code.
- Whenever possible, document important information directly within the codebase itself.

By adopting these practices, you can enhance collaboration and facilitate a better understanding of the codebase within our community.

### Naming convention

Please refer to [Univer Naming Convention](./docs/NAMING_CONVENTION.md).

### Submitting pull requests

Before merging a pull request, please make sure the following requirements are met:

-   All tests are passed. ESLint and Prettier errors are fixed.
-   Test coverage is not decreased.

We provide preview deployments for pull requests. You can view the preview deployment by clicking the "Preview" link in the "View Deployment" section.

### Documentation

If you are adding a new feature, please make sure to update the documentation accordingly. Refer to our [documentation repository](https://github.com/dream-num/docs) for more guidance.

### Storybook

We use Storybook to develop and test components in isolation. It is a great tool to develop UI components in isolation, which can improve component reuse, testability, and development efficiency. You can use the following command to start Storybook:

```shell
pnpm storybook:dev
```

When a new pull request is submitted, a Storybook deployment will be automatically generated. You can view the Storybook deployment by clicking the "Preview" link in the "View Storybook" section.

### Debugging

We provided some Visual Studio Code (vscode) tasks to help you debug in vscode.

After stating dev server, you can launch Edge or Chrome instance and debug in vscode, and you can debug directly in vscode!

### Unit test

To ensure the quality of the code and move with confidence, we require that all code must be covered by unit tests. We use vitest as the unit test framework. You can use the following command to run unit tests:

```shell
pnpm test
```

Also, with the help of vscode and its rich ecosystem, you could directly debug unit tests in vscode. Please install the extension we recommend, and you will see the debug button in the side bar. In addition, if you add a new plugin, you should update `vitest.workspace.js` to include the new plugin.

### E2E test

You may need to install dependencies of Playwright manually by running the following command:

```shell
pnpm exec playwright install
```

If you would like to develop E2E tests, you can use the following command to run the dev server:

```shell
pnpm dev:e2e
```

and then run the following command to run E2E tests:

```shell
pnpm test:e2e
```

### Build Preview

After building, the output may differ from the source code. To test for any differences, you can link to the built artifacts using:

```shell
pnpm build
pnpm dev:libs
```

### Update Snapshots

Univer uses Playwright to perform visual comparison tests. If you have made changes to the UI, the CI may fail due to visual differences. You can update the snapshots by running this GitHub Action [ðŸ“¸ Manually Update Snapshots Â· Workflow runs Â· dream-num/univer (github.com)](https://github.com/dream-num/univer/actions/workflows/update-snapshots-manually.yml) on your branch.


### Clean code

> Programs are meant to be ready by humans and only incidentally for computers to execute. - Harold Abelson

-   Do not expose properties or methods those are not necessary to be exposed.
-   Group related methods or properties together. Do not always use blank lines to separate them.
-   Keep your concepts consistent by naming your variables consistently.

### New Package

Create a new package with our CLI tool:

```shell
# pnpm
pnpm create @univerjs/cli init <project-name>

# npm
npm create @univerjs/cli init <project-name>

```

### How to Contribute to Facade API
#### Synchronous API Priority
* For asynchronous APIs, consider the following: Can a synchronous sub-API be extracted, separating logic such as secondary confirmation.
* For APIs that must be asynchronous, indicate this in the method name, such as `addCommentAsync`.

#### Chaining Principle
*. APIs must adhere to the chaining principle.
*. APIs with `modify` semantics should return `this`.
*. APIs with `create` semantics should return the created instance.
*. APIs with `delete` semantics should return `true/false`.

#### Easy to Get
*. All APIs/constants/enums should be accessible from the `univerAPI` variable.
