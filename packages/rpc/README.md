## Introduction

When handling some time-intensive tasks, such as formula computation, Univer can offload them to a location outside of the main thread, such as a Web Worker thread. The `@univerjs/rpc` library provides an RPC mechanism that simplifies communication between the main thread and other threads.

For more information, see the [Architecture of Web Worker](https://univer.ai/guides/sheet/architecture/web-worker).

# Using npm
